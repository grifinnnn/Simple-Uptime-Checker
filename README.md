# Simple Uptime Checker

Background: I run infrastructure which hosts a frequently used Minecraft server & media server. With our apartment's power not being the best, we lose power sometimes when we use the microwave or when we take long trips. My partner wants to learn a little bit about coding and I wanted to create a discord bot, so this seemed like the perfect project to work on together. The goal is to create a modular discord bot that will notify the user's discord server if it sees the infrastructure is down. 


Requirements: 
1) A discord bot that will ping a channel whenever the server is down.
2) The bot has customizable settings via discord, so you can change what IP address it will look for, what to say when the server is down, etc.
3) If the server is down, the bot will not spam that the server is down.
